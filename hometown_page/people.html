	  <h1>Kindness in Community</h1>

	  <p>People in our town loves to cook food for parties.You will be offered to bring some food with you when you go back home. There are a lot of kids I can play with in my hometown. Sometimes we collect straws and elastics. Then, make a slingshot out of it. We can make boring things fun. Someone just needs to get an empty can, a match, and a barbecue stick. Then, voila! We made kebob leaves. There is a small tree near my cousin’s house, and it amazed me because I can make bubbles out of it. We have small red flowers bundled together called Santan. My girlfriends mostly turn it into garlands, bracelets and crown. Its nectar is also sweet.

	<h3>Livelihood</h3>
	<div id="hero">	
	  <p>Majority of our neighbors are entrepreneurs. Our nearest neighbor has a “sari sari store” (mini convenience store). Every morning, you will hear people yelling “binatog”(white corn kernels), “taho”(soya pudding) or “pandesal”(bread rolls). They visit every neighborhood to sell their goodies. In the afternoon, they have sticky rice cakes for sale which is great for afternoon teas.  In the evening, there will still be people yelling “penoy balut” which is an exotic food made of duck embryo.  </p>
